# E-Commerce Customer Spending Prediction
This project uses a linear regression model to predict yearly spending based on customer behavior data from an e-comerce clothing store.

## Dataset
The data is found on Kaggle from an e-comerce store based on customers who buys clothes online. The store offers in-store clothing advice sessions. Customers come into the store for a session with a personal stylist to get advice, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The store is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

This data includes customer email, address, avatar, average session time with stylist, time spent on the mobile app, time spend on the website, the length of their membership with the store, and the yearly amount spent shopping at the store.
